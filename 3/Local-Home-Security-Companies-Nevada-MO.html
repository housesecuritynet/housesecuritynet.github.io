<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Paying for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as often times as you want.</p>

Keep in mind: a good alarm is an investment in your security and personal wellness. The mere existence of an alarm is typically a deterrent. Market the reality that your home or business is alarmed by using a warning decal.</p>
