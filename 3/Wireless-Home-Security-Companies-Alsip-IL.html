We have actually seen enhancements throughout our short time with the battery-operated camera, but we just can't suggest a $200 camera that does not provide the capability to zoom video and will not have the ability to endure outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit. Activate expert monitoring with a Ring Secure Plus subscription to get a lot more for a lot less. For just $10 a month or $100 a year, you can watch your cost savings grow with Ring.</p>
<p>We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, but the black and white version can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't truly a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with black and white.
