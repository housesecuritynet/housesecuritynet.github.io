It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really great.
