The first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection against dust and dirt). The 2nd number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded versus close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
