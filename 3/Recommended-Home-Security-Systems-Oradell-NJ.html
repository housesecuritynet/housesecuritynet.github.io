<h3>Home Security Installation Companies in New Jersey</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

It's not for everyone, however it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
