<p>The security systems above are our favorites, but we found 3 more companies you might be thinking about if you have some specialized requirements. No duress alternative: A professionally monitored system typically features a duress PIN. The property owner can turn off the alarm utilizing the pressure PIN if an intruder forces a homeowner to deactivate the system. While the alarm is off, the duress code works as a secret signal to the monitoring company to send out help right away. Self-monitoring systems do not have this option.</p>
<h3>Best Security Camera System in Winder GA</h3>

<h3>Home Security Companies Near Me in Georgia</h3>
<p>A smart lock is typically part of a robust wise home security setup, but you don't have to invest in a full-blown system to utilize one. You can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort if you're using a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats. Alternately, if you don't have a home automation hub, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that includes its own mobile app. Smart locks use basic pre-drilled holes and are fairly simple to install. Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
<p>Efficient in running in both normal and inadequately lit environments, these cameras take advantage of not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra delicate imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are perfect for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to function optimally. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're picked the wireless, battery powered model, but there is a wired variation too if you don't want to worry about ever having to recharge the batteries.</p>
