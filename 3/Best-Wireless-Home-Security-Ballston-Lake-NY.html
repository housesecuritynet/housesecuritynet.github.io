<p>D-Link has four cameras. The DCS-8000LH has no two-way audio, and the DCS-8010LH displayed bad images; the dcs-8525lh and the dcs-8300lh are pestered by a bad app and missing signals. The Angee is low on features and big on operating expenses. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often showed pink and green lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera constantly flickered in the evening; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
