<h3>Alarm System Homes in Lebanon NH</h3>

When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
