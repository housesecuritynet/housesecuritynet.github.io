Lookout is really simply a terrific name for a set that consists of a Wink wise home center and a few security oriented sensors. You can't disarm the system and arm. Rather, you turn signals on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or set off the siren.
