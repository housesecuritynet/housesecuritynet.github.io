<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
