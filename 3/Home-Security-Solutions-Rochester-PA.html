<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are typically poor night vision entertainers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to illuminate the area listed below it. Sadly, the night vision illuminators that come with consumer cameras are created for brief range only and are of a repaired brightness. This suggests they usually over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing items and individuals to appear blown out" and with no information. So much for trying to determine the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely detail. It has restricted effectiveness if a camera can not record and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night.</p>

Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
