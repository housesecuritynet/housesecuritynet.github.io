<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
