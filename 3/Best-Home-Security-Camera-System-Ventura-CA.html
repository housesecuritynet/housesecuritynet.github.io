That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to record again, which indicates you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't advise that for home security since if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
