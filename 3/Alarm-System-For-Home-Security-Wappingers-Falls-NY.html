If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
