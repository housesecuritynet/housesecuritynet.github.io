<h3>Security Surveillance Cameras in Saint Joseph MN</h3>
<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>

Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
