Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
