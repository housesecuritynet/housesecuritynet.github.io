<h3>Home Alarm Security System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would signal users when it found any type of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the problem. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they only run when you're out of the house. Do not think they'll safeguard you if someone enters when you're sleeping! Rather the opposite, your alarm really disregards motion sensing unit signals if you arm the system but stay home. If the system worked any other method, it would false alarm each time you strolled into a secured room.</p>
