This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras.

<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, but if you're worried about security, you don't wish to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with alternatives for more via subscription. Although it does not have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
