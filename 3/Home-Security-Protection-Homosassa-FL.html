<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. As you begin looking for a house alarm company, there are a number of things you require to watch out for. When you're dealing with companies who install exclusive systems and claim that they only work with their certified monitoring systems, continue with care.

To be sure, opt for a company that offers you full access to your shows and code features and uses non-proprietary components.</p>

<p>I have this camera attached to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
