<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
