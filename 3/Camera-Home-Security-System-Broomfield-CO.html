<h3>Video Security System Broomfield CO 80020</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
