<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it includes person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone informs-- and, sometimes, less incorrect informs. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location, you won't need to worry about it tape-recording or sending out an alert whenever the dog strolls by. (We believe this is a better feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars often pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
