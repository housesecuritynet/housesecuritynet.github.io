When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV).
