<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, fewer false informs. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area, you won't have to stress over it recording or sending out an alert every time the pet walks by.
