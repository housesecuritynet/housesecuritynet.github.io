<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it enables you to control practically every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely personalized.
