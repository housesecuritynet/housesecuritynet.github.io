Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's costs from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be applied rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services. You will not get a cash or charge card refund of your pre-payment. Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under suitable law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by suitable law, return an amount equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any quantities due on your account (consisting of, without restriction, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, modified or not returned).</p>
