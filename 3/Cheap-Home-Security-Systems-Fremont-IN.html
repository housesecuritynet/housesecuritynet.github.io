<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wished to set up seeing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. However, those features come at a relatively steep cost: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 each month for person detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
