It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
