<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a great security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Excellent ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does offer a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for example, work with the IP cameras just from specific manufacturers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you must initially ensure that the gadget will work with the cameras you have actually acquired. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should have the ability to provide you with the necessary information.</p>

<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston locals have alternatives. You can select a nationally acknowledged brand or opt for a local company.
