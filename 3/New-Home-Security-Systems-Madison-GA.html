<p>All individuals with alarm systems securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm authorization. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional information that might never ever have been possible previously, such as alert of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the structure. A picture of that employee is presented on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating occurs.</p>
