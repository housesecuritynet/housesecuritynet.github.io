<p>Often a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. However, the two are considerably various. The main difference is that the wired system pairs with the other smart home devices to create a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other smart devices and can not be controlled from another location. Likewise a local alarm will not contact the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to alert individuals close by.</p>
