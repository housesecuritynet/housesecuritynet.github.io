<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they vehicle restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too expensive, and not great.</p>
<p>so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an apparent indication for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and criminal activity. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of usage, night and day images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion found. We have actually seen it highlight mice, automobiles, and moths.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both animals and humans. Because carbon monoxide gas is odorless and colorless, the only method to monitor harmful levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Luckily, most wireless security systems include carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your house increases to a dangerous level. With a wireless system, you can also receive push notifications on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not at home.</p>
