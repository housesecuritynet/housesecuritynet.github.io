<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
