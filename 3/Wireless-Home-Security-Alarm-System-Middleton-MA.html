<h3>Security System Cameras in Middleton MA</h3>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its double articulating LED floodlights cover a very wide area, and you can dim them through its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or patio for a celebration. In addition they can not transmit fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video.

<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is really simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices.
