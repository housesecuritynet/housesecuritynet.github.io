<p>You're in the eye of the public when you're in a public space. So what's the difference in being watched by a closed circuit TELEVISION camera? Even if you were captured picking your nose the police aren't going to apprehend you for that and no surveillance officer is going to put it on nationwide tv.

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having problem. This is a simple switch that is usually open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and informs, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not just providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
