<p>The Wyze Camera can likewise catch video to the cloud, but the free account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

Wyze's just recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between.
