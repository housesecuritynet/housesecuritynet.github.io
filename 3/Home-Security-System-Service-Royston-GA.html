<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
