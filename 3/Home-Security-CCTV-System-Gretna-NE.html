They have actually been carried out for public safety and crime avoidance and are not for the exploitation of people. An individual with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, may have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital technology and the Web can break privacy laws with far more terrible repercussions than video surveillance cameras, which are kept protected and in rigorous self-confidence.</p>

A couple of other companies (like Abode, ring, and nest) have no-contract systems. But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more market experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system.</p>
