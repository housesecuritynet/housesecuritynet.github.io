<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
