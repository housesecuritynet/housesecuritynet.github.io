<h3>Wireless Video Security System Dumont NJ 07628</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
