<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level.

If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
