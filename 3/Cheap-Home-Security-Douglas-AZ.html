<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
