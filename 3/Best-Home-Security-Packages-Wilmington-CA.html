<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious assaulter, since the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and actually indirectly protects information by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the harmful assaulter to tape these codes and use different splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>
