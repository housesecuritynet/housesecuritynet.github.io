<h3>Remote Security System Bellbrook OH 45305</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
