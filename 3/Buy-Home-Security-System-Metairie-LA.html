<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we enjoyed it as an animal web cam ). It has since been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home combination choices. We value that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

If this takes place, call your present monitoring company to verify. Usually, you would be alerted of a modification like this by mail or telephone, not by an unannounced check out by a representative from another company.</p>

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. Because it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
