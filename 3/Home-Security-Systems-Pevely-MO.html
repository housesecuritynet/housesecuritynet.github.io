<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire community. As you start looking for a house alarm company, there are a number of things you need to look out for. Proceed with caution when you're dealing with companies who install exclusive systems and claim that they just work with their licensed monitoring systems. You should also watch out for organizations who will not let you change your passcode or switch to another company even after your contract has finished. To be sure, go with a company that provides you full access to your programs and code features and utilizes non-proprietary elements.</p>

Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
