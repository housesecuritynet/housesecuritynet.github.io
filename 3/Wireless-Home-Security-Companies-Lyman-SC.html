Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can activate when you're far from home or whenever you pick.

These sensing units can operate as part of your security system or by themselves, and they vary in size and design from tiny, sleek sensing units to large and apparent. Sensing units likewise differ in sensitivity. Some may activate when the door or window vibrates versus really opening.</p>
