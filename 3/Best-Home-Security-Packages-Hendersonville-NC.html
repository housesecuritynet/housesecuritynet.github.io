Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
