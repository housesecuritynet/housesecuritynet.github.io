The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers bring into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
