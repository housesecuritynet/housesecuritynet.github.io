You will not receive a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under relevant law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by suitable law, return a sum equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without limitation, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, altered or not returned).</p>
