<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments offer a number of "totally free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
