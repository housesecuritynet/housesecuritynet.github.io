Once a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
