<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Wish to add a flood sensing unit? A smart door lock? Your system can serve as a hub for as much as 119 wise home devices, and can be managed via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can likewise be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different source of power, meaning a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also usually regarded as a more secure way to transmit information.</p>
