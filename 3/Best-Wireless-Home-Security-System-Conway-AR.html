<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet webcam ). It has actually since been enhanced and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza.
