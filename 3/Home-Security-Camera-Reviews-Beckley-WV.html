<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 ends up being more costly general per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
