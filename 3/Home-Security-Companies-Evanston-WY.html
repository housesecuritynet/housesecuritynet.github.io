<h3>Security System Equipment Evanston WY 82930</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
