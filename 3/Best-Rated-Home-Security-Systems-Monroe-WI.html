<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart excessive. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your house. The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill inbuilt alarm, so it operates as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera. That separates it from the items I've currently written, and assists in part to describe its price.</p>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
