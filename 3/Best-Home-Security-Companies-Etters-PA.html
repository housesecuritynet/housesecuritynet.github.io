<p>All individuals with alarm systems safeguarding a property in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control becomes part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional information that might never have been possible in the past, such as notification of an employee, by name and recognition number, getting in the building. An image of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating takes place.</p>

<p>Although it has a lot of versatility in positioning, the Nest Web cam Outdoor does need a power source, so it must be positioned within reach of an outlet. This can be a problem outside your home.
