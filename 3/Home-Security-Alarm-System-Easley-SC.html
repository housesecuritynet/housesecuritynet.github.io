<h3>Best Home Security Alarm System in South Carolina</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

(You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more costly general per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
