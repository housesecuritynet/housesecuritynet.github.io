<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV).
