<h3>Best Alarm Security System in Severn MD</h3>
<p>Firstly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of usage, night and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We've seen it highlight mice, cars and trucks, and moths.</p>

<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Excellent clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.
