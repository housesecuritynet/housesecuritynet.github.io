<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
