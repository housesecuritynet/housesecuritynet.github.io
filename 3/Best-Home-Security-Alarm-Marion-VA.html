<h3>Cost Of Home Security System in Virginia</h3>
<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The majority of security cameras can be utilized both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the exact same features like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor options due to the fact that their design permits minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because typically times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more accurate and less regular alerts.</p>
