<p>All persons with alarm securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm authorization. While monitored systems are more comprehensive and do most of the work for you, an unmonitored system depends on somebody accountable (we're looking at you) to help do a few of the work. You can generally install these systems on your own, and they are much, much more economical. Also, there's no fear of entering an agreement you can't get away when you require to.

Furthermore, most unmonitored security systems will send out alerts to your mobile phone, making it easy to understand if there's a threat to your property.</p>
