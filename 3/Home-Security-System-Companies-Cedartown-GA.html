<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would inform users. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the problem.

<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your kids and family pets, but if you're concerned about security, you do not wish to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with choices for more via membership. Although it does not have the largest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
