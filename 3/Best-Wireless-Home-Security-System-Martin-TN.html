These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home.

We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
