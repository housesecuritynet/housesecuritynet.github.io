<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. Ring video security cameras are hd, however they are set to record just when motion is detected.

Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't advise that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
