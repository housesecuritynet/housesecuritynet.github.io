<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
