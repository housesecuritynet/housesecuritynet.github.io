<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
