<p>After utilizing designs long-lasting for over a year, in addition to testing a number of new designs, we still think the Logitech Circle 2 is the best indoor security camera. We know how expensive changing exclusive technology can be. That's why we only offer equipment that all alarm companies can monitor so that you can recycle the very same system indefinitely. If you ever want more functions, you can simply add on private tools for a relatively low price.</p>
<p>The Wyze Web cam can also catch video to the cloud, but the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes prior to it's able to tape again, which means you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security since if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
