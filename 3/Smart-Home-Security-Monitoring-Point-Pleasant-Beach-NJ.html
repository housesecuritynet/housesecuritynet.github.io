<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
