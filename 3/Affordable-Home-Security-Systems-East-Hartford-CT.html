<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. But the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is spotted. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds person detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, sometimes, fewer false alerts. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area, you won't need to stress over it recording or sending an alert each time the pet dog walks by. (We believe this is a better function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks regularly pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Webcam.</p>
