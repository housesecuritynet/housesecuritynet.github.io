<h3>Alarm System Monitoring Beaverton MI 48612</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
