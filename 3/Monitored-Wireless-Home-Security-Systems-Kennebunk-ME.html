<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic package if you can't manage the extra equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
