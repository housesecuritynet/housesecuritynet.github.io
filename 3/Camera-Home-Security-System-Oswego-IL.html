<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to save and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out too much. Pretty easy to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your house.
