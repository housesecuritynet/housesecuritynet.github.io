Canary has packed adequate security features into this Wi-Fi camera to make it receive home insurance discount rates from numerous significant insurers.

Wireless systems are inexpensive and are much better for the average homeowner. Their low cost is among the reasons that they have actually become so popular over the past several years.</p>

(We think this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks frequently pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Web cam.</p>
