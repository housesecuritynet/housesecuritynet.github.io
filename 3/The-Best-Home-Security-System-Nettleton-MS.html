<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we don't believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
