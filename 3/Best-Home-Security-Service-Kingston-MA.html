Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not advise that for home security since if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
