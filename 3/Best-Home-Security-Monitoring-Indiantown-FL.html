Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free.

Although battery replacements are essential, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the taped video is stored in the cloud.</p>
