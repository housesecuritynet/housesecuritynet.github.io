<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. Ring video security cameras are hd, but they are set to tape-record only when motion is detected. This puts less need on your home Wi-Fi service compared with popular competitors like Nest Secure that record constantly.

Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not great.</p>
