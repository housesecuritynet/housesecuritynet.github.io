<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your animals and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you do not want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with choices for more by means of subscription. Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that come with a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
