No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Paying for the equipment up front offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
