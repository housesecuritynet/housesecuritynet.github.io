Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
