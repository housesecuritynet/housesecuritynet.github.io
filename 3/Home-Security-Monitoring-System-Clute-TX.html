<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Terrific clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter informs, for example. However, those features come at a relatively high cost: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for individual detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage up to 31 days.</p>
<h3>Home Alarm Systems With Cameras Clute TX 77531</h3>
