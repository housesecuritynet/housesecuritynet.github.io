<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". Many wireless home security systems are DIY and simple to connect using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have an expert install your security equipment, you'll conserve cash from installation expenses. And when you're all set to move, merely pack up your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or arranging a specialist. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during heavy traffic. After the awful attacks, cops reviewed CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists entering the train station, bring backpacks loaded with explosives. The terrorists were tape-recorded on several CCTV cameras, but sadly they were neither seen nor intercepted before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
