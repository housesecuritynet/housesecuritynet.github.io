Protection 1 provides complete video security camera image storage services on our secure server. This enables you to have a record of events and can help aid law enforcement in case of a burglary or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most common, and when an electric current is continuously running around the boundary of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electrical existing. This trips the alarm system and sets off the matching alarm. Closed-circuit systems are also tripped if the burglar cuts the power, as the circuit is broken.</p>
