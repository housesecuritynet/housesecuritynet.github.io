ADT uses an independent distributor design including third-party dealers. The dealers determine which equipment to use. Costs for systems vary.

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
