<h3>Residential Alarm Systems Villa Park IL 60181</h3>
<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They normally have the same features like night vision or remote viewing, however they differ in durability. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most long lasting. Because their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more accurate and less frequent alerts.</p>
