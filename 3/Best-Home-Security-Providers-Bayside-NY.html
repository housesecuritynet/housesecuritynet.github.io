<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed.

<p>Arlo claims that you need to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
