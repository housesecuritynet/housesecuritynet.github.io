We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION).
