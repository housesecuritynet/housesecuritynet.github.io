<p>Motion sensors provide backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. However they only operate when you're out of the house. When you're sleeping, do not think they'll secure you if someone gets in! Quite the opposite, your alarm system actually overlooks motion sensing unit signals if you arm the system however stay home.

<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension set, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more costly general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
