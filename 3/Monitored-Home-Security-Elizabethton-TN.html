<p>Emergency dialer: If you do not wish to link to a monitoring service, buy a dialer and program it to call and play a taped message to next-door neighbors and friends to inform them of an alarm at your home. Among the very first factors to consider is whether you want an expertly set up or do-it-yourself system. The latter is perfect for organisations that are brief on funds. Expert installation by a security company is a good idea if you need to follow the very best practices and reduce the threat of security breaches.
