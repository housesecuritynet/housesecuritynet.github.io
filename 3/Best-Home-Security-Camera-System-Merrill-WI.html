<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They normally have the very same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they vary in durability. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices since their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have actually a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will provide more accurate and less regular signals because many times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
