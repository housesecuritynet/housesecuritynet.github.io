<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, hesitation has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. Do alarm systems represent robbery declines in the United States?
