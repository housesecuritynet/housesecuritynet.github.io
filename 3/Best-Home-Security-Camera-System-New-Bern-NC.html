Wyze's just recently launched Complete Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
