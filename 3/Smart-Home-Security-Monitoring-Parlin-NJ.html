<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Put simply, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors required to control your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you immediate signals. Once a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, email, web, or text portal. If your wireless home security system is expertly monitored, they'll likewise get an alert to instantly help you with emergency responders as needed.</p>

<p>All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This generally includes finding an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. A number of them then enable you to configure the alert frequency and develop activity monitoring zones, so the camera will catch motion just in designated areas-- a feature we find necessary for high-traffic areas, which could trigger a lot of false signals.</p>

The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the upfront cost of the control panel, activation charges, monitoring charges and all equipment. All of these expenses will be paid in advance if the wireless security system is not on an agreement basis. Some customers report spending $500 as much as $2,000 to kickstart their wireless security system.</p>
