<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assailant, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the harmful opponent to tape-record these codes and use various cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
