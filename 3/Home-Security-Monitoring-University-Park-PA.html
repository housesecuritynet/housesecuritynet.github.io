It has actually because been enhanced and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration choices. We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a minimal field of vision, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
