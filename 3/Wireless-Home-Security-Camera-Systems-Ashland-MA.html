CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card.
