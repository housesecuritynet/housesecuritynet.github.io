<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are often poor night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a light to light up the location below it. Regrettably, the night vision illuminators that feature consumer cameras are created for short variety only and are of a fixed brightness. This suggests they generally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing individuals and things to appear burnt out" and without any information. So much for trying to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, typically are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene.
