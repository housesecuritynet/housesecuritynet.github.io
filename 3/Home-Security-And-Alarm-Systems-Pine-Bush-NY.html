<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Purchasing a wireless security system for your home is going to be an investment at first. Some systems also provide or require an expert monitoring service for an extra month-to-month charge. They may make a time-limited deal, and claim that you need to act now. For instance, they may attempt to get you to sign an agreement by informing you that the equipment is "totally free." More than likely, strings are connected. For example, to get your "complimentary" alarm, you might need to sign a long-term and pricey  system monitoring agreement.</p>

<p>The security systems above are our favorites, but we found three more companies you might be interested in if you have some specialized requirements. No pressure alternative: A professionally monitored system frequently includes a pressure PIN. The property owner can turn off the alarm using the pressure PIN if an intruder requires a homeowner to deactivate the system. While the alarm is off, the pressure code functions as a secret signal to the monitoring company to send out assistance right away. Self-monitoring systems don't have this alternative.</p>
