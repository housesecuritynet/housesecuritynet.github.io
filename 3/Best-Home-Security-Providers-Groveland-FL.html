<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Sound for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. We recommend the eight-piece set due to the fact that it features several windows and door sensors for complete protection. We also recommend including a doorbell video camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Factor in the upfront cost of the control panel, activation fees, monitoring costs and all equipment. All of these expenses will be paid in advance if the wireless security system is not on an agreement basis.
