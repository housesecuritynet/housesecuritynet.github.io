<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based upon available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
