<p>All individuals with alarm protecting a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a valid alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses extra information that might never ever have actually been possible before, such as notice of a staff member, by name and recognition number, entering the building. An image of that staff member is presented on screen for verification (verifying it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>

<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
