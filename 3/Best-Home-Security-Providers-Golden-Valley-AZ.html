<p>Some wireless systems are vulnerable to structural or electromagnetic interference. Radio frequencies go around solid objects; they can not go through them. So positioning sensing units in the right locations is essential if you want them to work correctly. Your alarm company ought to notify you exactly where each part ought to be installed so there is no confusion.

<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another factor to read your existing alarm contract carefully.
