After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send smart device informs with that details when they appear at your home.

We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
