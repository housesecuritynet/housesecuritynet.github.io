<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system versus short-term surges that can go into through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones. It's not just about security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital options and development at Amica, advises sensing units that concentrate on things you would not otherwise discover, like leak sensing units or freeze sensors. Given benefits like that and the more direct capabilities of monitoring and safeguarding your home, it might be the right time to upgrade your security. SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. However while ADT systems work with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously restricts your alternatives for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party smart home devices like lights, thermostats, outlets, and locks. If you currently have a security device from another brand name, like a Blink XT camera, it probably won't work with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
