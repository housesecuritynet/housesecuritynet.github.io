It ships with 4 white and sleek bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to supply up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>Capable of operating in both typical and badly lit environments, these cameras gain from not needing inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional sensitive imaging chips. For this reason, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are not able to work optimally. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're chosen the wireless, battery powered design, however there is a wired version too if you don't wish to stress over ever having to charge the batteries.</p>
