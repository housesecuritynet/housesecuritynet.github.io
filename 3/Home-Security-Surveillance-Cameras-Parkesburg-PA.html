<h3>Safe Home Security System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would notify users when it discovered any type of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>

That's why we advise the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with choices for more by means of membership. Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
