A number of other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
