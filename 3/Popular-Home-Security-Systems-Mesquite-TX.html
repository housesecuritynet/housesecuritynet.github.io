<p>All persons with alarm safeguarding a facility in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control belongs to the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional details that might never have been possible previously, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, getting in the structure. A picture of that staff member is presented on screen for verification (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating occurs.</p>

<p>If you're searching for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with four white and sleek bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage. They're equipped with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and smart IR to offer up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
