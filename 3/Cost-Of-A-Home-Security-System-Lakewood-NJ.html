Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
