Frontpoint has more expensive monitoring strategies than comparable offerings from its rivals, especially if you're trying to find home automation functions. But it's an all-around solid option with some of the best customer care in the business.</p>
<p>The Wyze Cam can likewise capture video to the cloud, however the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to record once again, which indicates you may be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently introduced Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
