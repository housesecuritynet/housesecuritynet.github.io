<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

It uses a proprietary connection approach that doesn't deal with Z-Wave or Zigbee like a lot of other home automation devices. Plus, there's no professional monitoring choice and no siren.</p>
