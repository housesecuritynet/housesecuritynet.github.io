<p>Another way to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is comparable in performance to a PC with a capture card and proper video recording software Unlike PCs, the majority of DVRs developed for CCTV purposes are ingrained devices that require less upkeep and simpler setup than a PC-based option, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras. Due to the fact that everything is merely stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, getting rid of cameras, detectors, and other elements of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new place takes minutes, not days.
