<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Terrific clearness. I wanted to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company.

Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively high price: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.

<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
