<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an obvious indication for anybody who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a terrific deterrent of theft and criminal activity. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a larger area such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>

The first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of strong things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection versus dust and dirt). The 2nd number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded against close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>The drawback? It's really simple to dedicate security errors that will leave your home vulnerable. The moment you eliminate of signal variety or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you have actually left your house open.
