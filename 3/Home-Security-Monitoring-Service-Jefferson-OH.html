The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, usage and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.
