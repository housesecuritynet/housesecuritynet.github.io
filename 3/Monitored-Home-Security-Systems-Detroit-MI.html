<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Wish to include a flood sensor? A clever door lock? Your system can serve as a center for as much as 119 smart home gadgets, and can be controlled by means of Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can also be connected to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends information from the camera and offers power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a different power source, suggesting a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are likewise typically considered a more secure method to send information.</p>
