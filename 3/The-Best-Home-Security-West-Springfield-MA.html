<p>Some home insurance coverage companies need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms needed by insurer should adhere to the European Requirement EN 50131 and should be set up by an NSI or SSAIB certified installer. All of the clever alarms on the marketplace currently do not adhere to the European Requirement, and as they're developed to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurance company.

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you desire the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel strategy and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the price of equipment and $10 additional a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't afford the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
