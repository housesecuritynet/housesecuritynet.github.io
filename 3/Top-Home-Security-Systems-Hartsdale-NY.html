<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, since they supply no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
