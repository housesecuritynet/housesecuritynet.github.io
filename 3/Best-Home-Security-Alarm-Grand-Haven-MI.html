<p>All individuals with alarm systems safeguarding a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm authorization. The integration of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra details that may never ever have been possible previously, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, getting in the building. An image of that worker exists on screen for confirmation (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating takes place.</p>
