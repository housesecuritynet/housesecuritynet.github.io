<p>Arlo claims that you must have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
