<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote.

The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of circumstances for somebody to successfully hack the system.

Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the present system.</p>
