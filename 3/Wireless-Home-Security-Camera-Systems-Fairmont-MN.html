<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive enemy, considering that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards information by avoiding it from being sent. The typical factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the harmful opponent to record these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
