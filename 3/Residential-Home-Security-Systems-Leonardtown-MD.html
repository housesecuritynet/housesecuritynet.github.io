<h3>Best Home Security System in Maryland</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV).
