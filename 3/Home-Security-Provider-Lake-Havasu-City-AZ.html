The Ring products are light-weight and long lasting, and the keypad digits have a more vintage feel when you push them.

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and pets, however if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage totally free, with options for more by means of membership. Although it doesn't have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
