<h3>Electronic Security Systems Newberg OR 97132</h3>
<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 winds up being more costly total per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it given that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
