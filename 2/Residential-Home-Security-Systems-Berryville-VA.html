<p>Prior to you choose a video surveillance camera, make sure you know precisely what you need to survey. Conditions such as indoor or outdoor place and the presence or lack of light will play a huge function in choosing which camera is best suited for the job at hand. Several other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it permits you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's highly adjustable.

Also, a number of these systems can integrate with other smart-home gadgets, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs.
