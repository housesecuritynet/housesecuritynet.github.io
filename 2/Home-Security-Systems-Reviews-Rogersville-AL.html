<p>I ask forgiveness to all the Wink fans out there, however to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually simply a great name for a kit that includes a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensing units. You can't equip and deactivate the system. Rather, you turn signals on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or set off the siren. Read our evaluation here.</p>

<p>It worked well when we tested the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensors are a bit big, which can be troublesome for doors with molded or small frames. (To counteract this issue, Ring's launched a slim magnet, which can be bought independently.) And the $199 five-piece kit doesn't have sufficient equipment to safeguard most homes completely.
