<h2>Why You Need A CCTV Security System Berwyn</h2>

<p>Arlo claims that you need to be able to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
