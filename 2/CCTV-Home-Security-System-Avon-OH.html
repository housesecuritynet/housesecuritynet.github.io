<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
