I likewise like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your home. The 2nd essential thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably raucous in-built alarm, so it operates as a home alarm along with a security camera. That distinguishes it from the products I've currently composed, and helps in part to describe its price.</p>
<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
