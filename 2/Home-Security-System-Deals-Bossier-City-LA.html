Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
