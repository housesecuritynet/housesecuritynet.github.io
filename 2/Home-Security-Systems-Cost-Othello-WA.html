Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
