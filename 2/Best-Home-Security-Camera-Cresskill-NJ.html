<p>Now let's examine why consumer-grade cameras are frequently bad night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a light source to light up the area listed below it. Sadly, the night vision illuminators that include customer cameras are created for short range only and are of a fixed brightness. This implies they usually over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering individuals and things to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear effectively exposed and in full information.
