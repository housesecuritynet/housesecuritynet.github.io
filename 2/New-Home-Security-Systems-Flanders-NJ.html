<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, peace of mind and fulfillment to every consumer and are devoted to fulfilling our consumer's needs with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the web and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the recorded video footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
