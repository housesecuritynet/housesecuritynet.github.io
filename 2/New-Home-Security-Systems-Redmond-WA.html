Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the taped video is stored in the cloud.</p>

<p>Naturally, the obvious downside to a wired security system is that the initial install can be pricey. If the system was not set up throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed off in attics or basements.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would signal users when it found any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
