<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, because it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
