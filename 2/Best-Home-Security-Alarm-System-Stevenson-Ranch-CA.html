<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
