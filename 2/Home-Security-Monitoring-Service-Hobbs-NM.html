<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set quantity of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
