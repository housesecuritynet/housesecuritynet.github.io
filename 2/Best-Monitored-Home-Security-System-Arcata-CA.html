<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with normally onerous and long agreements, and typically depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed individually and don't suggest for most people.</p>
<p>We have actually tested multiple self-monitored systems consisting of home, eTiger, Scout, iSmartAlarm, SimpliSafe, SmartThings (v1, v3, and v2), Piper, Armorax, SkyLink, Oplink, GetSafe, Ring Alarm, Nest Secure, and dozens of security cameras.
