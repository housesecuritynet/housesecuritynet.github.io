<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature level differences.
