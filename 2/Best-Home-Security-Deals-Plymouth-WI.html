<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers.
