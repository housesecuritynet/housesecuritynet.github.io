<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
