<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Terrific clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. Nevertheless, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.
