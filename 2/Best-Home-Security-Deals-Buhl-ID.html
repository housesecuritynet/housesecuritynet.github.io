Nearly all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your web goes down or your power heads out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their main interaction source. Most internet connected security systems come with a battery backup, which implies if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a limited amount of time. But, if your web decreases, sadly, you will lack an alarm till it comes back up.</p>
