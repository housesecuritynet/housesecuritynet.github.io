If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't suggest that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
