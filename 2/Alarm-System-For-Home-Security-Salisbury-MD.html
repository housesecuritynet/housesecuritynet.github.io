<p>All persons with alarm protecting a facility in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a valid alarm permit. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface offers additional information that may never ever have been possible before, such as alert of a worker, by name and recognition number, getting in the structure. An image of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (validating it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>
