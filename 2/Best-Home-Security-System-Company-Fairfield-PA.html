<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in false alarms. Practically all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your web goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their main communication source. A lot of internet connected security systems feature a battery backup, which implies if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a minimal amount of time. However, if your web decreases, regrettably, you will be without an alarm until it comes back up.</p>
