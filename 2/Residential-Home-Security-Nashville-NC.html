<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.
