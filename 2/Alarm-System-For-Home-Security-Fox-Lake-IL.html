<p>While every homeowner frets about burglaries, hesitation has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated agreements with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often leading to false alarms. Practically all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your web decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize an internet connection as their primary interaction source. Most web connected security systems feature a battery backup, which means if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a restricted amount of time.
