However, after nearly two years of usage, night and day images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We've seen it highlight mice, moths, and automobiles.</p>
