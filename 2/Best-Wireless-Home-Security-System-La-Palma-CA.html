<p>Arlo declares that you need to be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained pipes the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
