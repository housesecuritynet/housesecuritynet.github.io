<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They generally have the very same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and sometimes, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices since their design permits minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection. This will provide more precise and less frequent signals because oftentimes the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
