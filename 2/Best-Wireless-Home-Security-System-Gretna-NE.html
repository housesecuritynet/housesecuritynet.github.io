<h3>Business Security Alarms Gretna NE 68028</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
