<h3>Home Burglar Alarm Brentwood NY 11717</h3>
<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
