The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
