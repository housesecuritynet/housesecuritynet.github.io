<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not believe that these issues change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present suggestion.</p>
<p>Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and choose your alert settings. Required a security system but don't understand where to start?
