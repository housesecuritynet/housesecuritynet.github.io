Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that obviously they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
