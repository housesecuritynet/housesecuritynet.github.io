<h3>Home Burglar Alarm in Roscommon MI</h3>

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
