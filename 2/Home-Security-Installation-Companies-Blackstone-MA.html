<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it spotted any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of scenarios for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the issue. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential offenders are less likely to commit crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer should know the added surveillance for it to attain its preferred effect.</p>
