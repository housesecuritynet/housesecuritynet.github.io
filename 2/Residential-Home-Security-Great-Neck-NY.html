<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
