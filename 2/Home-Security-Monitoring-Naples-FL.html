<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a remarkable worth. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does offer a Complete Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we loved it as an animal camera ). It has since been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration options. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with person detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
