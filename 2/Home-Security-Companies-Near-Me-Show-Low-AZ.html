Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise required under applicable law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by applicable law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any amounts due on your account (consisting of, without restriction, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, modified or not returned).</p>

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
