<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer free" alarm systems are just concealing the equipment cost in your 3-5-year agreement. That equipment is spent for within the very first year, however do they reduce your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years. That forces you to greatly overpay. Besides overpaying, what if their service is poor? Regrettable, you're trapped in their contract.</p>

<p>All of the systems we have actually evaluated function an app that lets you utilize your mobile phone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, develop guidelines, add and delete components, and get push notifications when alarms are activated. Many apps also permit you to do things like view live and recorded lock, video and unlock doors, change thermostat settings, and silence alarms. Some apps will even use your phone's place services to automatically deactivate the system and arm according to your physical location. The more expensive systems usually feature a wall-mounted panel that serves as a communications center, with a touch-screen screen that allows you to do whatever the app does. The display lets you interact with an expert monitoring service when an alarm is triggered and see video from any of the installed security cameras.</p>
<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another reason to read your existing alarm arrangement carefully. ADT for example offers free" home security systems when you register for their multiyear alarm monitoring plan. Obviously nothing is totally free. In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control board, keypad, motion sensing unit. Anything added additional you would own but if you don't restore their high priced plan they'll eliminate their" equipment leaving you with no working alarm system. Simply another sneaky approach to retain highly lucrative accounts.</p>
