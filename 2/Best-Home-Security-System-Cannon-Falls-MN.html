Setting up the Arlo Pro 2 alarm is incredibly easy and can be done in about 15 minutes. You have to link the base station to the router using the supplied cable. Following that, you need to just download the Arlo smartphone app and link the cameras to the base station to make them go live. Arlo Pro 2 has a number of expensive membership packages. Nevertheless, for self monitoring functions, you can get the Basic Plan which allows you to cover up to 5 cameras and gives you access to 7 days of video recordings free of charge.

<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to six months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
