<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurance companies use discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments provide numerous "complimentary" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
