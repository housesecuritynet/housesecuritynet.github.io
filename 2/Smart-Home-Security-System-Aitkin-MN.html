<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that might match some of our top picks. It also comes with two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 mentioned that uses a mix of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when deciding.</p>

<h3>Wireless Video Security System Aitkin MN 56431</h3>
<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, since it includes 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds expensive, but it's not a lot when you consider that a live human is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can alert a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, however it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
