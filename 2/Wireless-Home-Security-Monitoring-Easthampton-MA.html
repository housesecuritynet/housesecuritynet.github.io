(You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey total per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
