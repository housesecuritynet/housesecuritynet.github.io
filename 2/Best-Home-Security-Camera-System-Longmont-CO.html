<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
