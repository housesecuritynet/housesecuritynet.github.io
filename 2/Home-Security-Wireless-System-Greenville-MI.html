Although you will not have a professional install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation expenses. And when you're all set to move, merely evacuate your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or scheduling a specialist. In the London subway battles in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during rush hour. After the awful attacks, authorities reviewed CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists entering the train station, bring knapsacks filled with explosives.

The Nest also comes with clips to make the installation clean and harder to swipe off the side of a house.</p>
