<p>Door and window sensors are contact motion sensing units that set off an alarm when the secured door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're away from home or whenever you choose. For instance, you might keep the window sensors constantly activated but shut down the door sensors when you're at home. These sensing units can function as part of your security system or by themselves, and they vary in size and design from small, streamlined sensors to obvious and bulky. Sensors also differ in sensitivity. Some might set off when the door or window vibrates versus in fact opening.</p>

The likelihood of such a thing occurring, however, is quite low.</p>
