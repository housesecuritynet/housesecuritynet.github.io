Conditions such as outdoor or indoor location and the presence or lack of light will play a huge function in choosing which camera is best matched for the job at hand. Several other models were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>It worked well when we checked the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be troublesome for doors with small or molded frames. (To combat this issue, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be purchased independently.) And the $199 five-piece set does not have sufficient equipment to secure most homes entirely.
