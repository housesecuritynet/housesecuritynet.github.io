<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
