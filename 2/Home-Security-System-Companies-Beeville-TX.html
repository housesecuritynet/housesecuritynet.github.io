<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras reduce criminal offense. Camera systems help discourage crime and lower liability by offering an objective record of events. They can be set up on the exterior or interior of a building to monitor delicate areas such as entryways, car park, money spaces, or secure locations of a structure.

Answering the concern Who's at my door this time?" has never been much easier. Whether you're home or away, you can examine your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>

The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of usage, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and cars.</p>
