<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your pets and kids, but if you're worried about security, you do not want to risk missing out on a second of the action.

Even though it does not have the best operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that included a truly weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
