While we always encourage main station service, some security system owners do not need or want a central station involved. Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are cheaper and allow access to the excellent functions offered by Overall Connect,, or Telguard without being linked to the central station. Furthermore, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring plans enable remote access to the robust home automation alternatives provided through a Z-Wave allowed security system. Whether you reside in a region where central station service is not available or desired, self monitoring (provided world wide by means of web communications) is a cost efficient choice for keeping you connected and up to date with your professional security system.</p>
