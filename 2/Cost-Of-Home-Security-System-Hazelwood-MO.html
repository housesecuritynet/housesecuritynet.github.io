<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System  in Missouri</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smart device notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
