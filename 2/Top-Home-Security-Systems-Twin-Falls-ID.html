(You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
