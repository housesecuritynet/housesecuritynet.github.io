<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for watching on your animals and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you don't want to risk missing a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with alternatives for more by means of subscription. Although it does not have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
