<p>Some home insurance coverage providers need you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms required by insurance companies must abide by the European Requirement EN 50131 and should be set up by an NSI or SSAIB recognized installer.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assailant, considering that the interruption of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the destructive attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security essential caught during the network healing.</p>
