<p>Indoor cameras are great for keeping an eye on your family pets and kids, however if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action.

Although it does not have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
