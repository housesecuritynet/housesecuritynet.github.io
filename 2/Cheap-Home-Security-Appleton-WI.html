Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
