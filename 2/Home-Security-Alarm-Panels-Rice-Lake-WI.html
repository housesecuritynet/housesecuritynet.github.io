<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive opponent, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly safeguards data by avoiding it from being transmitted. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the malicious attacker to tape-record these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
