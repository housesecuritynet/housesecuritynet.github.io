<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services using convenience, comfort and fulfillment to every client and are committed to satisfying our consumer's requirements with integrity, honesty, interest and exceptional service. Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to a router and the internet. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the taped footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
