However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their main interaction source. Many internet connected security systems feature a battery backup, which means if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a minimal quantity of time. But, if your web decreases, sadly, you will lack an alarm until it comes back up.</p>
