<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are often poor night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it requires a source of light to light up the area below it. Sadly, the night vision illuminators that feature customer cameras are developed for brief variety just and are of a fixed brightness. This suggests they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering items and people to appear burnt out" and with no information. A lot for trying to recognize the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, often are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear correctly exposed and in full information. If a camera can not catch and provide a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and during the night, it has limited usefulness.</p>
