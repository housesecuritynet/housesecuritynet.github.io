<p>Most security cameras can be utilized both inside your home and outdoors. They typically have the same features like night vision or remote viewing, but they differ in durability. Outdoor cameras ought to be weather condition resistant and sometimes, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their design permits minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will provide more accurate and less frequent alerts because oftentimes the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
