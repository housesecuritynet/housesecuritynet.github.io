Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
