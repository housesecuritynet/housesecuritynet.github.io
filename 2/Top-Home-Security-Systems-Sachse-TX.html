<p>The 2nd main distinction is the prices. Wired systems can be infamously expensive. Every aspect of the system will cost you money. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

<p>first of all the plan seemed to have been opened when it got here. so then I open the cameras and whatever seemed OKAY until I started to install the cameras beyond my home and found out one one the cameras do not work and they don't come in color. Likewise I had to download the user's manual cause one isn't. provided. The wires are super thin too. The cameras are OKAY for the cost I guess.
