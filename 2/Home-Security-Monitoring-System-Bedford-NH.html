<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies provide discounts on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
