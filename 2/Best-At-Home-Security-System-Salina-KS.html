Likewise I had to download the instruction manual cause one isn't. provided. The wires are very thin too. The cameras are OK for the cost I guess.

<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.
