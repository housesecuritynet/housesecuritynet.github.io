<p>Flood lights are typically used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors detect motion, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will permit you to see who is on your home and will possibly scare off trespassers. Better outdoor lighting also means a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When selecting flood lights, consider the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can deter vandals or terrify them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
