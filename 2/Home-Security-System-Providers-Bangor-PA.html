<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if needed, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less most likely to commit crime if they believe they are being seen or have a higher risk of being collared. This is likewise known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to upset can be decreased by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a culprit being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and lowering provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the culprit must be aware of the added surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted impact.</p>
