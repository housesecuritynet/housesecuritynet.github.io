<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is required. There are just 2 choices if there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration info to make this combination work. The very first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is reluctant or not available to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months. Scout is extremely easy to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it allows you to control nearly every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable.
