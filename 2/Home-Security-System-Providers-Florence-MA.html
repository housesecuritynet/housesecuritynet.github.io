<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
