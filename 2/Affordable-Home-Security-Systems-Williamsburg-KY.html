<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive assailant, considering that the interruption of the network prevents the circulation of information and in fact indirectly secures information by preventing it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the malicious assailant to record these codes and use various breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>

The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
