<h2>How To Position Home Security Cameras Wood Ridge</h2>

<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
