<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Great clearness. I wanted to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary charge. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 each month for person detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
