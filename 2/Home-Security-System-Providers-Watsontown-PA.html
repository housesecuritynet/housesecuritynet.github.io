CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a remarkable value. It receives an Excellent score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card.
