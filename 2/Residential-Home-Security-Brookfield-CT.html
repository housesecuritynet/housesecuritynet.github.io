<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
