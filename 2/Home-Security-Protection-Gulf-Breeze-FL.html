<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
