<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
