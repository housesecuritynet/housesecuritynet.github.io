<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences.

If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current suggestion.</p>
