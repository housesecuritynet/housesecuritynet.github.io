When sensors discover movement, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will potentially frighten burglars.

<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He provided the suggestions regarding what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek got here and handled the installation right on time. He talked to us regarding positioning of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He also helped me in filling the app and finishing the online set-up procedure. He also reviewed the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were very professional and useful. Thanks.</p>
