<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too pricey, and not great.</p>
<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He provided the suggestions regarding what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek showed up and managed the installation right on time. He talked to us concerning placement of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also assisted me in packing the app and finishing the online set-up procedure. He also examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were extremely professional and helpful. Thanks.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
