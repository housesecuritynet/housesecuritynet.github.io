Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
