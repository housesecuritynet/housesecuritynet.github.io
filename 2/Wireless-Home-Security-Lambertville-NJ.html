<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer free" alarm are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is paid for within the very first year, however do they reduce your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 regular monthly rate for at least another 2+ years.

If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
