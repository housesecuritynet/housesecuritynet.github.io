No duress option: An expertly monitored system frequently includes a duress PIN. The house owner can turn off the alarm utilizing the duress PIN if an intruder forces a property owner to deactivate the system. While the alarm is off, the pressure code functions as a secret signal to the monitoring company to send out assistance right away. Self-monitoring systems do not have this alternative.</p>
