The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the destructive assaulter to tape these codes and use different breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
