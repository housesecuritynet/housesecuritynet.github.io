When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
