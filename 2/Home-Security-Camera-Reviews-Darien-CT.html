<h3>Home Alarm System Cost Darien CT 06820</h3>
<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide several "complimentary" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
