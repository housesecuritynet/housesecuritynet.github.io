<p>Arlo declares that you ought to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
