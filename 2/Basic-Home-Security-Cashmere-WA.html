<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Excellent clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively high rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary cost. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 monthly for individual detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and features storage approximately 31 days.</p>
