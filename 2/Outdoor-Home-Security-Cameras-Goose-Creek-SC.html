<p>Hello Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? If yes, you may access this camera by means of your smartphone or PC and have a look at whether your camera is working. If not, you may have a look at the dome camera at night and see if there is any red glow released by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. The dome camera is working if yes. Hope this helps.

<p>Arlo declares that you need to have the ability to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
