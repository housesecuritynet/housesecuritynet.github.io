<p>Home security must never ever be limited by where you can put or power your cameras, indoors or outdoors. While we always encourage central station service, some security system owners do not require or desire a central station included. Alarm Grid's self monitoring plans are less costly and permit access to the excellent functions offered by Total Connect,, or Telguard without being connected to the main station. Additionally, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies allow remote access to the robust home automation options provided through a Z-Wave allowed security system. Whether you reside in an area where main station service is not available or wanted, self monitoring (offered world large via web interactions) is a cost efficient choice for keeping you linked and as much as date with your professional security system.</p>
