<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire family will love. It's a neat trick, and one that works quite well, but just when you've configured the remainder of the settings. I have actually got a big pet dog, so needed to specify the areas for the camera to spot i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet dog will be strolling. After a couple of false informs, and a very startled partner, I started to rely on the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident!
