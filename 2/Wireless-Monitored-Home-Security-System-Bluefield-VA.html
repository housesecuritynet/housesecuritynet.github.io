Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
