<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see listed below) technically has all the same smarts and more comprehensive 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still exceptional, and it's slightly better value - though its cost is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the normal Arlo traits in terms of the strong build quality, excellent camera video footage, lots of creative features and a polished app.</p>
