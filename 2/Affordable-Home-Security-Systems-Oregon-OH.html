We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
