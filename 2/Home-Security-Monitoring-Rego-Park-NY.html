<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we loved it as a family pet cam ).

We value that the company continues to repeat and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
