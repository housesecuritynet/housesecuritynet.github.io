<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Most wireless home security systems are Do It Yourself and simple to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have an expert install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation costs. And when you're prepared to move, simply evacuate your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or setting up a service technician. In the London train battles in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during heavy traffic. After the awful attacks, police examined CCTV camera video and saw the terrorists entering the train station, carrying knapsacks filled with dynamites. The terrorists were taped on numerous CCTV cameras, however unfortunately they were neither seen nor obstructed before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
