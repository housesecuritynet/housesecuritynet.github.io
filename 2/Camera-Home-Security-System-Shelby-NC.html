Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

<p>IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means web procedure) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company utilizes.

After screening, we sent out each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Camera v2, to Expense McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing. (Bill is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec man.")
