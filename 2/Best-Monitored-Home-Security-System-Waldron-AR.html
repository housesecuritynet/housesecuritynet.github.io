<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your pets and kids, however if you're worried about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with options for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it does not have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
