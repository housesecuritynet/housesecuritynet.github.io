Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no gaps in between.
