<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive total per system than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it considering that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
