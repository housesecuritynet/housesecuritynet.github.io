<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the present system.</p>
