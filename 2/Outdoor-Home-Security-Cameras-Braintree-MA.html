<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We recommend the eight-piece kit since it comes with numerous door and window sensors for full protection. We also suggest including a doorbell camera at some point. The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Consider the in advance cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring costs and all equipment. If the wireless security system is not on a contract basis, all of these expenses will be paid in advance.
