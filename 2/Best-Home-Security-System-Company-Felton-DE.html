<p>All About Security offers expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis location. Figure 1-1 portrays an example of a CCTV installation that keeps an eye on select locations of coverage. The first installation was created and developed for the different parking facility. This application included several fixed position cameras on each floor of the parking garage, stairwells, and exits, all connected directly to a main control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic gadget for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cables. Supplementary energies and devices can offer simple integration of some alarms, but this innovation has restricted capabilities and a complex integration process.</p>

<p>Exterior - Even if your business does not keep anything of valuable outside, exterior security cameras can often be just as valuable as cameras positioned within. Exterior security cameras can monitor the parking lot, capture license plate numbers, or grab a shot of a thief's face if the indoor camera misses it. Exterior cameras can also provide employees leaving late in the evening with comfort. On the other hand, if you don't wish to bother with this process yourself, you can use the Brinks Pro Install services. The installation fee for this additional service is $199 if you pay in advance or $10 per month.</p>
<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more in-depth 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still exceptional, and it's slightly much better worth - though its price is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the typical Arlo characteristics in regards to the strong build quality, superb camera video footage, tons of smart features and a refined app.</p>
