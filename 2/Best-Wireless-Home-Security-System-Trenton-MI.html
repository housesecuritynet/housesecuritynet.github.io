<p>While some parts might be impacted for a little while by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours till the electric service is brought back. Landline systems utilize conventional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
