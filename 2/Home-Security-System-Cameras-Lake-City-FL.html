<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, but the white and black variation can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a big offer considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar energy with a solar panel charger.</p>
