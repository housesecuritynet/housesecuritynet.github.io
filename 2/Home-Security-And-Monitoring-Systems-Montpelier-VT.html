Watch video from several cameras at the same time.</p>
<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we enjoyed it as a pet cam ).

We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
