<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
