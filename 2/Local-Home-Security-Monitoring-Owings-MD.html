<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Numerous insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments provide a number of "totally free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
