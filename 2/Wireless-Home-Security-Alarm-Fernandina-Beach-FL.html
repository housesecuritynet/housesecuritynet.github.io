Do alarm systems represent break-in decreases in the United States? The U.S. theft rate has decreased progressively and substantially because the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the same time, the number of properties with alarms increased, but there is no evidence of a link in between the 2. Throughout the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a steep increase, other kinds of crime declined just as dramatically as burglary, suggesting that aspects besides a boost in the number of alarm systems fueled the break-in decline.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out mobile phone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
<p>It worked well when we evaluated the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be inconvenient for doors with small or molded frames. (To counteract this concern, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be purchased independently.) And the $199 five-piece package does not have enough equipment to secure most homes completely. Overall, however, everything did what it was supposed to do. View our reviews and scores, and browse our purchasing guide to find the very best security camera for your home.</p>
