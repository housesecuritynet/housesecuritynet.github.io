Wyze's recently launched Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't advise that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
