That indicates the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record once again, which means you may be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
