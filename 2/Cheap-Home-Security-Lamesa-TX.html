<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing convenience, peace of mind and fulfillment to every client and are committed to fulfilling our consumer's needs with stability, honesty, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
