<h2>Cloud Video Monitoring & Video Surveillance For Security Cameras Rotonda West</h2>
<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer totally free" alarm systems are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year contract. That equipment is paid for within the first year, but do they decrease your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 regular monthly rate for at least another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly overpay. Besides paying too much, what if their service is poor? Regrettable, you're trapped in their agreement.</p>
<p>The Wyze Cam can also capture video to the cloud, however the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That indicates the camera will wait 5 minutes prior to it has the ability to tape once again, which means you might be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently released Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
