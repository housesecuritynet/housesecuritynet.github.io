Although some companies supply complimentary or greatly reduced hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some people might wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Sound for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We advise the eight-piece package since it comes with numerous windows and door sensors for full coverage. We also advise adding a doorbell video camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be costly. Factor in the upfront cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring fees and all equipment. If the wireless security system is not on a contract basis, all of these costs will be paid in advance. Some customers report investing $500 up to $2,000 to kickstart their wireless security system.</p>
