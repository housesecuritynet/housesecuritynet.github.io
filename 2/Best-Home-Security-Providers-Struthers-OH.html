<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Terrific clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for thirty days of video history.
