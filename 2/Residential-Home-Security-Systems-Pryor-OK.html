In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
