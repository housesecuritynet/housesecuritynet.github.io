Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
