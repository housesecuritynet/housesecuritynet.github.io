<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to incorrect alarms. Do alarm systems account for robbery decreases in the United States? The U.S. robbery rate has actually decreased progressively and considerably given that the early 1980s. 13 During the same time, the number of facilities with alarms rose, but there is no proof of a link between the two. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a high rise, other kinds of criminal activity declined just as dramatically as burglary, suggesting that elements other than a boost in the variety of alarm systems sustained the theft decrease.</p>

However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
