Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then links to the web and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no gaps in between.
