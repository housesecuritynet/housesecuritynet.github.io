<h3>Best Security Alarm System For Home Sharon Hill PA 19079</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
