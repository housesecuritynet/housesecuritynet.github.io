<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
