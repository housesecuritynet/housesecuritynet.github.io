Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be applied as a credit to charges due on the following month's costs from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services. You will not get a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under suitable law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by suitable law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any quantities due on your account (including, without constraint, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, changed or not returned).</p>
