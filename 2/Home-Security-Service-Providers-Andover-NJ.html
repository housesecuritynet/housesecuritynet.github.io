<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This implies the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey total per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
