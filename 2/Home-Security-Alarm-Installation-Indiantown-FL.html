<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
