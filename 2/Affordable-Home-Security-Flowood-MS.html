<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.

I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they auto restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, method too costly, and not excellent.</p>
