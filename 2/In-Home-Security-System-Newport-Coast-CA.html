<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
