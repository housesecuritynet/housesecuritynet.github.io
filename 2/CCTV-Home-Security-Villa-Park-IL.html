<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
