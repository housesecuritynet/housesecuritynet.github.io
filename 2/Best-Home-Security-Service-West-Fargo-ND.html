<p>Arlo declares that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
