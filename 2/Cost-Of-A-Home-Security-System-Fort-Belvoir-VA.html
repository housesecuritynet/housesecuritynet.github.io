A Few Of Google Nest's cameras do provide facial acknowledgment, however they can't trip alarms (based on whether they acknowledge somebody or otherwise).

<p>A wireless home security system utilizes a radio frequency to communicate with the control panel and sensors. The control board then communicates with a monitoring center utilizing a cellular signal.

The cops will be sent directly to your home if you're not able to do this.</p>
