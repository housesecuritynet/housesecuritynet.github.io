<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
