<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
