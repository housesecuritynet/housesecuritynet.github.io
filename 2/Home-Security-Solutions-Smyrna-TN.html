<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". A lot of wireless home security systems are DIY and simple to connect using 'how-to' videos or the provider's manual. Although you will not have a professional install your security equipment, you'll conserve cash from installation costs. And when you're prepared to move, merely evacuate your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or setting up a specialist. In the London train bombings in 2005, terrorists carried bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them during rush hour. After the tragic attacks, police examined CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, bring knapsacks loaded with explosives. The terrorists were recorded on several CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither seen nor obstructed before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
