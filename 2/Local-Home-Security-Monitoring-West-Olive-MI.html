Conditions such as indoor or outdoor area and the existence or absence of light will play a huge function in deciding which camera is best matched for the task at hand. Several other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
