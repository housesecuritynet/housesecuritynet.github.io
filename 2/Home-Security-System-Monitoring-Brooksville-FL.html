<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
