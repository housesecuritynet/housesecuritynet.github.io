<p>Residence also provides a Smart Security Package that includes only one entry sensing unit and one motion detector. Since that limitations the number of entryways you can safeguard, we believe Residence works best for smaller areas like an apartment or dorm.

If you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages, be definitely sure you can afford it.
