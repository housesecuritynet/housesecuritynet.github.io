<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
