<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files providing functionality and configuration information to make this integration work, there are only two alternatives. The first alternative, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unwilling or not available to offer those information) and document the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
