<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive assaulter, because the interruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and actually indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and utilize various splitting tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network healing.</p>
