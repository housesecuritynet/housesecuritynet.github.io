Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
