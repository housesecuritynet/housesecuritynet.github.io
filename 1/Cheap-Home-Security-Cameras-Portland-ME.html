<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. As you begin searching for a house alarm company, there are a number of things you require to keep an eye out for.

We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
