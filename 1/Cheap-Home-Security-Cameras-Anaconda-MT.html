<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, given that the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and actually indirectly secures data by preventing it from being sent. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to tape-record these codes and utilize various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security essential recorded during the network healing.</p>
