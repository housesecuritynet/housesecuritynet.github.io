<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
