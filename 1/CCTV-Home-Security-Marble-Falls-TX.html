<p>As the name recommends, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's basically expected that it will not have actually extended customizability or a vast array of features.

Now it is a surveillance network of 350 cameras, all of which share video footage with the cops.

<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Fantastic clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my cellular phone however had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial charge.
