<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Simply put, wireless security systems depend on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to receive sensors needed to manage your equipment consisting of allowing, disabling and sending you immediate notifies. When a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, email, text, or web portal.
