<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We suggest the eight-piece package because it features multiple windows and door sensing units for complete coverage. We also advise including a doorbell video camera at some point. The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Consider the upfront cost of the control panel, activation fees, monitoring charges and all equipment. If the wireless security system is not on a contract basis, all of these costs will be paid in advance. Some clients report spending $500 approximately $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>
