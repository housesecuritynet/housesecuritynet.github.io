<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
