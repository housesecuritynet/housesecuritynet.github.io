<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If recording video footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
