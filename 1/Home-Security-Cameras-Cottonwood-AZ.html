<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote.

The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
