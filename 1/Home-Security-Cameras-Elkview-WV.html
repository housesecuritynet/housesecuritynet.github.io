<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If capturing video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
