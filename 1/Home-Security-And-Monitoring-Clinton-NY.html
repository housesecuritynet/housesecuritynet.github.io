<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
