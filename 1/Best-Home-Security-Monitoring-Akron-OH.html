<h3>House Safety Alarm System Akron OH 44312</h3>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective wrongdoers are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a higher risk of being captured. This is also known as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that chances to anger can be reduced by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being captured, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and minimizing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the transgressor should understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its desired effect.</p>
