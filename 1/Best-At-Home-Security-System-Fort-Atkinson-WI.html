<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential transgressors are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a higher danger of being nabbed. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be decreased by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer must know the added surveillance for it to achieve its wanted result.</p>
