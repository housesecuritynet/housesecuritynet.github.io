Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
