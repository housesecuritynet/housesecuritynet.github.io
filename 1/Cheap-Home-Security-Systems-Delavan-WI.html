<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives because their style allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more accurate and less frequent informs.</p>
