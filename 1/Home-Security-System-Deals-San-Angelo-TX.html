<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such occurrences.

If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
