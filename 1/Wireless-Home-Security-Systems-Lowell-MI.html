Rather of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based regular monthly charge, most Do It Yourself systems give you the versatility to chose how and when you monitor your home. That usually suggests you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel at any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Elements we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensors and door sensing units be included, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be integrated into an existing clever home setup, including with voice commands through Amazon Alexa.</p>
