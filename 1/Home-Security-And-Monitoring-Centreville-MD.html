<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". Most wireless home security systems are DIY and simple to link using 'how-to' videos or the provider's handbook. Although you won't have a professional install your security equipment, you'll conserve money from installation costs. And when you're ready to move, just pack up your equipment and reinstall it without untangling wires or scheduling a service technician. In the London subway bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto trains and buses, detonating them during heavy traffic. After the tragic attacks, cops evaluated CCTV camera video footage and saw the terrorists getting in the train station, bring backpacks loaded with explosives. The terrorists were recorded on a number of CCTV cameras, but unfortunately they were neither discovered nor obstructed before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
