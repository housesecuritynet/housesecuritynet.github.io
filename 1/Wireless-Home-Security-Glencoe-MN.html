<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we loved it as a family pet camera ). It has actually since been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration options. We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with person detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
