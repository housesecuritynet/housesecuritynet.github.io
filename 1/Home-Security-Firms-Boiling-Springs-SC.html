<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
