<p>One category where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer care. A lot of users are not extremely happy with the method dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for false alarms since they can frequently result in added fees. Furthermore, the overall viewpoint is that the company's customer service is not really valuable when it comes to fixing issues and recurring usage concerns.

Nevertheless, surpass that fiddly start and you find this is a pretty decent home security camera.</p>
