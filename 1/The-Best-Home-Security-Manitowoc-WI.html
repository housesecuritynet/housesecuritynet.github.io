<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
