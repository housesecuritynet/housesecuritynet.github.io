<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and configuration information to make this combination work, there are just 2 choices. The very first alternative, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is reluctant or not available to provide those details) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
