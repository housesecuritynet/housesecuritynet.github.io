Outdoor security cameras can discourage lawbreakers and offer an early caution before somebody enters your home.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
