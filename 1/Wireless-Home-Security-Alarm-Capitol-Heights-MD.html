<h3>Security Camera Equipment Capitol Heights MD 20743</h3>
<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to overlook items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
