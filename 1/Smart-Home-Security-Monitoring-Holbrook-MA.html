Wyze's just recently released Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
