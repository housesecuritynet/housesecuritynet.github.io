<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
