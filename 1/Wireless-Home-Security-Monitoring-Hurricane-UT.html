<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented video. The footage is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

This is also referred to as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of an offender being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the wrongdoer must understand the included surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
