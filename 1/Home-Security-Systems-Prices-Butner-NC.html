<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would notify users when it spotted any type of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of circumstances for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>
