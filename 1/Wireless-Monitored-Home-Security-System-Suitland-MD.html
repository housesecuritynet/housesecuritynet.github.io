<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential offenders are less likely to dedicate crime if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher danger of being collared. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be lowered by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer should know the added surveillance for it to achieve its wanted impact.</p>
