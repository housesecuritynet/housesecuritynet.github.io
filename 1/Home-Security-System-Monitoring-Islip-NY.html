<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
