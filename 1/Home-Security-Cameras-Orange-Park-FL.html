<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
