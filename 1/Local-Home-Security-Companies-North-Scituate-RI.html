<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
