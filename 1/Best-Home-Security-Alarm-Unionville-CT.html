Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several years.

The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and see it later on.
