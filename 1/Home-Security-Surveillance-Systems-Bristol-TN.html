<p>Indoor cameras are great for keeping an eye on your kids and family pets, but if you're concerned about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we suggest the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which offers continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with choices for more via subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that come with a truly weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
