<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are often bad night vision entertainers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it requires a light source to brighten the area below it.

This means they typically over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering people and items to appear blown out" and with no detail. A lot for trying to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness instantly to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and in full information. If a camera can not capture and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and in the evening, it has limited effectiveness.</p>
