<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we loved it as a family pet cam ). It has since been enhanced and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home integration choices. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.

However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.
