<h3>Best Security System Itasca IL 60143</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
