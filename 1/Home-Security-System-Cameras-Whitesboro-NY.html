<p>Arlo declares that you need to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level.

If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
