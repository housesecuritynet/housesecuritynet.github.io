Since you won't have an on-site expert to install the system, any faulty equipment might develop into a frustrating delay.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is really easy to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to control practically every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's extremely personalized.
