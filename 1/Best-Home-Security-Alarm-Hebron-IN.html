<p>Incorrect alarms are expensive for the City of Plymouth. Authorities respond to countless false alarms each year.

<p>Most importantly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly 2 years of usage, day and night images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when checking the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and vehicles.</p>

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights at night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
