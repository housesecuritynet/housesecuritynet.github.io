<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
