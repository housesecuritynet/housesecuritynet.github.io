Nearly all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your web goes down or your power heads out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that use an internet connection as their main interaction source.

Commercial cameras, nevertheless, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness instantly to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear appropriately exposed and completely information.
