You may even provide guidelines on how to get into your structure. As recently as ten years earlier, customers did not have access to technology that let them manage their own home security systems. Smart alarm altered that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company. The customer paid regular monthly charges.</p>
<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek handled the installation and showed up right on time. He consulted with us regarding positioning of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in packing the app and finishing the online set-up process. He also evaluated the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were handy and extremely professional. Thanks.</p>
