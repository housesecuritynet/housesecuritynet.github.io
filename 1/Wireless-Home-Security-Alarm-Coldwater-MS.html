<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires.
