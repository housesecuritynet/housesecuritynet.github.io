Ring makes a range of popular video doorbells, but the company faces unpleasant privacy issues over its controversial data-sharing partnerships with authorities companies.

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We suggest the eight-piece package due to the fact that it includes numerous windows and door sensors for full protection. We also suggest adding a doorbell video camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Factor in the upfront cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring charges and all equipment. All of these costs will be paid upfront if the wireless security system is not on a contract basis. Some consumers report investing $500 approximately $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>
