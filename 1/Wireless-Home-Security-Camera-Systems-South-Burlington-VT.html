<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being collared. This is also referred to as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and lowering justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the transgressor must be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its desired result.</p>
