They have been implemented for public safety and criminal activity avoidance and are not for the exploitation of individuals. An individual with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital technology and the Web can violate privacy laws with much more disastrous repercussions than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in stringent self-confidence.</p>
