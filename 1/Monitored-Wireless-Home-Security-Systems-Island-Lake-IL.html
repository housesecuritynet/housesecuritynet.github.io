<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole household will enjoy. It's a cool trick, and one that works quite well, however only as soon as you've configured the remainder of the settings. I have actually got a huge dog, so needed to define the locations for the camera to spot i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet will be walking. After a few incorrect alerts, and a really startled better half, I began to rely on the system. Although anticipate a loud shock if you move it by accident! You can adjust sensitivity and also pick how and when the alarm is activated (manually, instantly or after an app message), which is sensible.</p>
