<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
