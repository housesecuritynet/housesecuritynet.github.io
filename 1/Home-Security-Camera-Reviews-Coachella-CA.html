<h3>Security Camera System in Coachella CA</h3>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
