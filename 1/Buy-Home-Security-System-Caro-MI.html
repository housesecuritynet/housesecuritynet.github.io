We have actually been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you select the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small cost. We recommend the eight-piece kit since it comes with numerous windows and door sensing units for complete protection. We also recommend adding a doorbell video camera at some point. The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Factor in the in advance cost of the control panel, activation costs, monitoring charges and all equipment. All of these costs will be paid upfront if the wireless security system is not on a contract basis. Some consumers report investing $500 as much as $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>
