Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the internet. Finally, wire-free cameras are entirely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the easiest option to install and all of the taped video footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
