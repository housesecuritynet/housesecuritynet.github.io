<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are often poor night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a light source to light up the location below it.

This indicates they normally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering individuals and items to appear blown out" and without any information. So much for trying to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and in full detail. If a camera can not catch and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night, it has actually limited effectiveness.</p>
