<p>Do-it-yourself home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world.

Elements we thought about included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensing units and door sensing units be integrated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it deal with your door locks and can it be incorporated into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands via Amazon Alexa.</p>
