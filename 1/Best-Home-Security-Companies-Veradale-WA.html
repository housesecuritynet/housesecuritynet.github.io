Even though it doesn't have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
