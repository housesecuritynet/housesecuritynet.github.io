Having an obvious CCTV system, or another security alarm, makes your house seem a harder target so the criminals will likely proceed to the next house. Modern CCTV systems can be monitored through cellphone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have web coverage. Some systems even offer motion detection so when motion is found, an alert can be sent to your phone.</p>
<p>Smart-home integration: Most outdoor cameras provide some kind of smart-home integration, such as assistance for Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, IFTTT (If This Then That), SmartThings, and more. No matter your surveillance system setup, the kind of security camera you pick will have an incredible effect, and there are lots of types of security cameras out there. Each of these cameras has its own strengths and weaknesses, its own benefits and drawbacks, so it's essential you make an informed choice. Remember, you're encouraged to mix-and-match camera types when installing the security camera system that's right for you.</p>
