<p>Arlo claims that you ought to be able to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
