Although some companies offer totally free or greatly reduced hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some individuals may wish to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in total control of the equipment you use, as well as how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it considering that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
