<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". Want to include a flood sensor? A clever door lock? Your system can function as a hub for up to 119 wise home devices, and can be managed through Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is called a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a different power source, indicating a more complicated setup and more wires. PoE switches are also normally considered a more secure method to transfer information.</p>
