However, after almost 2 years of day, night and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We've seen it highlight moths, vehicles, and mice.</p>

That distinguishes it from the items I have actually currently written, and helps in part to explain its price.</p>
