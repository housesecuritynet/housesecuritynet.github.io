<p>Arlo declares that you must have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

Fortunately, their systems are DIY; we had our sensors and cameras set up in about 25 minutes (not excellent, but not awful). The home intrusion functions were on-point, but we want to see more smart-home alternatives readily available out-of-the-box.
