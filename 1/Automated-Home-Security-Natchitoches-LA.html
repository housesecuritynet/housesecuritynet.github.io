They utilize infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, place it where it's most noticeable. Its wireless installation gives you a great deal of versatility. If the camera is battery powered you can put it basically anywhere with no wires, charging the battery and removing when it runs low, which is usually prompted through its app. Obviously the advantage is that these can be placed anywhere very easily, but the drawback is that if it's easy for you to remove the camera to alter the battery, it'll probably be simple for intruders to eliminate it too.</p>
