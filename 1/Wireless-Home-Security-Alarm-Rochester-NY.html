<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
