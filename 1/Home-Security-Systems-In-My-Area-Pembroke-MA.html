<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to store and the length of time you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
