Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
