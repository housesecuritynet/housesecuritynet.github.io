This suggests they generally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering individuals and things to appear blown out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, typically are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and completely information. If a camera can not catch and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night, it has actually restricted usefulness.</p>
