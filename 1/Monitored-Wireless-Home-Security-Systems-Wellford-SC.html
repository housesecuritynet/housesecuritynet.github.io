<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
