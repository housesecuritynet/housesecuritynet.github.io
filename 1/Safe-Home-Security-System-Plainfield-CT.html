<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
