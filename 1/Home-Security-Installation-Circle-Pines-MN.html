<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they believe they are being seen or have a greater risk of being apprehended. This is likewise known as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be reduced by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender needs to understand the included surveillance for it to attain its preferred result.</p>
