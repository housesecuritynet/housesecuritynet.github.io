<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective wrongdoers are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being watched or have a greater threat of being collared. This is also referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be lowered by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the transgressor should know the added surveillance for it to achieve its wanted result.</p>
