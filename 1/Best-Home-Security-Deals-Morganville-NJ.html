<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
