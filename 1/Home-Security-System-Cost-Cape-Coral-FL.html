Regarding how waterproof it is, time will tell. I hedged my bets and siliconed the body joint and where the wire enters into the back of the camera. I have this installed on the side of my rv, so it'll be evaluated.</p>

<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Florida</h3>
<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Because it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Regrettably I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
