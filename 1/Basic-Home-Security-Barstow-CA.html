However, alarms needed by insurer need to comply with the European Standard EN 50131 and should be set up by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer.

By integrating LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's professional monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other big names in the industry.
