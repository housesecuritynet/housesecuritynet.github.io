<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is very easy to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices.
