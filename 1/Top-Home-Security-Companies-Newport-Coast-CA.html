<p>Home security should never be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside your home or outdoors. While we constantly encourage main station service, some security system owners do not require or want a central station involved. Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are less expensive and permit access to the fantastic functions used by Overall Link,, or Telguard without being connected to the central station. Furthermore, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies allow remote access to the robust home automation choices provided through a Z-Wave enabled security system. Whether you live in a region where main station service is not offered or desired, self monitoring (offered world large through web communications) is a cost effective option for keeping you connected and as much as date with your expert security system.</p>
