Despite the fact that it doesn't have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
