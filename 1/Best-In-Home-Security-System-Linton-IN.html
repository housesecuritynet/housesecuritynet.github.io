<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole household will like. It's a neat trick, and one that works quite well, but just as soon as you've set up the rest of the settings. I have actually got a huge pet dog, so needed to specify the areas for the camera to discover i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the dog will be strolling. After a couple of false alerts, and an extremely startled other half, I started to trust the system. Although anticipate a loud shock if you move it by mishap! You can change level of sensitivity and also pick how and when the alarm is activated (by hand, immediately or after an app message), which is reasonable.</p>

<p>All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup procedure. This normally involves discovering a spot for your camera, developing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.
