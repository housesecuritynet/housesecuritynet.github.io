<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not breach any privacy concerns since they are set up in public locations. They have actually been carried out for public safety and crime prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals.

<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision choice, but the white and black variation can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage.

With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
