<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

This drained the camera to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
