<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it considering that its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
