<p>to begin with the package seemed to have actually been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and whatever seemed OKAY up until I began to install the cameras beyond my home and discovered one one the cameras don't work and they don't come in color. Also I needed to download the user's manual cause one isn't. offered. The wires are super thin too. The cameras are OKAY for the price I think.

<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.
