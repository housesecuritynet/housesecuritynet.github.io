<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it permits you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's extremely adjustable.

<p>Indoor cameras are great for watching on your kids and animals, however if you're concerned about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which supplies continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with choices for more by means of subscription. Even though it doesn't have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that come with a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
