The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies cast doubt on the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or 4 free false alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
