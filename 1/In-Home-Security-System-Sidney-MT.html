You might even offer guidelines on how to enter into your building. As recently as 10 years earlier, customers did not have access to innovation that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems altered that. Originally, standard security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, usually a home alarm company.

<p>I have this camera hooked up to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
