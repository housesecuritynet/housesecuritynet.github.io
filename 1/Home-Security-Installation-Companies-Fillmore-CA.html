<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He provided the suggestions regarding what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek managed the installation and got here right on time. He consulted with us concerning placement of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He also assisted me in packing the app and finishing the online set-up process. He also examined the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were very professional and helpful. Thanks.</p>

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand out excessive. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your house. The 2nd crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it functions as a home alarm along with a security camera. That separates it from the items I have actually currently composed, and helps in part to describe its price.</p>
<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
