<p>first off the bundle appeared to have been opened when it showed up. so then I open the cameras and whatever appeared OK till I started to install the cameras outside of my home and found out one one the cameras do not work and they do not come in color.

<p>While some elements may be affected momentarily by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours till the electric service is brought back. Landline systems utilize conventional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
