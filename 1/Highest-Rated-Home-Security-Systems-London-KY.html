<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could match some of our top choices. It also features 2 days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 pointed out that utilizes a mix of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind when making a decision.</p>
<p>When we checked the Ring alarm equipment, it worked well. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be bothersome for doors with molded or small frames. (To neutralize this problem, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be bought separately.) And the $199 five-piece package does not have sufficient equipment to protect most homes totally.

Nevertheless, get past that fiddly start and you find this is a quite good home security camera.</p>
