<p>Arlo claims that you must be able to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
