<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we enjoyed it as a pet web cam ).

We value that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
