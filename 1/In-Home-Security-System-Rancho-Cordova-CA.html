<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
