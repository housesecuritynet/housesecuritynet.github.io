Among IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free.

Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest option to install and all of the recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a best storm of situations for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the present system.</p>
