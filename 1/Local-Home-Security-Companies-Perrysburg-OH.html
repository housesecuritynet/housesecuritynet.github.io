SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would signal users when it identified any type of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the current system.</p>
