<h3>Home Video Surveillance Jim Thorpe PA 18229</h3>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential culprits are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being watched or have a greater risk of being apprehended. This is also known as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer must be aware of the added surveillance for it to achieve its preferred impact.</p>
