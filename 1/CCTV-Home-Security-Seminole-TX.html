<p>Indoor cameras are great for watching on your kids and family pets, but if you're concerned about security, you do not want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we recommend the corded version of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides continuous recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage free of charge, with choices for more by means of subscription. Despite the fact that it doesn't have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
