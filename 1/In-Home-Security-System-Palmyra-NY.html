<p>Arlo declares that you need to have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term screening of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
