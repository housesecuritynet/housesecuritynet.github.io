<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<h3>Home Alarm Installation Holyoke MA 01040</h3>
<p>While some parts might be affected for a short while by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for numerous hours until the electric service is restored. Landline systems utilize traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they typically have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
