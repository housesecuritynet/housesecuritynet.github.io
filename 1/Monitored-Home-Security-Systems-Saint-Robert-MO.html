<p>Emergency dialer: If you do not wish to link to a monitoring service, buy a dialer and program it to call and play a taped message to neighbors and good friends to inform them of an alarm at your home. Among the first considerations is whether you want an expertly installed or diy system. The latter is perfect for companies that are brief on funds. If you need to follow the best practices and mitigate the risk of security breaches, expert installation by a security company is suggested. Some hybrid designs leverage expert installation but at the cost savings of Do It Yourself systems if you want a bit of both worlds.</p>

It uses an exclusive connection approach that doesn't deal with Z-Wave or Zigbee like a lot of other home automation devices. Plus, there's no pro monitoring option and no siren.</p>
