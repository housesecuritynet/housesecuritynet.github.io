<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I advise to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an apparent sign for anybody who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a terrific deterrent of theft and criminal offense. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
