<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
