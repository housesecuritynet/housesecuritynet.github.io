<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When someone sounds the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera.

These cameras typically feature two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensing unit. Similar to any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of view. When wireless doorbell cameras trigger, the person outside your home will have no concept whether you are on the other side of the door or on the other side of the world.</p>
