<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's basically anticipated that it won't have extended customizability or a wide variety of functions.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>However for everybody who loves ADT, it looks like there's somebody who's had a dreadful experience.

When a company deals with several dealers and companies, its customers are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
