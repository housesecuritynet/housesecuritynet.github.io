<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, peace of mind and satisfaction to every customer and are devoted to fulfilling our consumer's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

<p>The Wyze Camera can also catch video to the cloud, however the totally free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes prior to it's able to tape-record once again, which means you might be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security since if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV).
