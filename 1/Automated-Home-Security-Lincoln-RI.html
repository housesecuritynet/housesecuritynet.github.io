<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
