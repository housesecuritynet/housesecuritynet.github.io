<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Buying burglar security systems and devices from eBay really makes alarm companies run away from a sale. A lot of alarm companies would rather provide and install their own equipment instead of go through this inconvenience.

<p>We love that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, however the white and black variation can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a photovoltaic panel battery charger.</p>
