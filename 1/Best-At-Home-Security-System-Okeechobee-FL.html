<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to save and how long you prepare to keep taped video footage. The footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to communicate with the control board and sensing units. The control board then interacts with a monitoring center using a cellular signal. And, if you have a video camera, the video recordings are sent out to a receiver that's connected to your local or cloud storage. The Nest Cam Outdoor uses a different mount, instead of an integrated one, so you're not restricted to viewing one location. The mount is magnetic, however it's strong, so you can quickly connect the camera and move it up, down, and everywhere in between.</p>
