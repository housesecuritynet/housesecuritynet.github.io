<h3>House Burglar Alarm Burtonsville MD 20866</h3>
<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
