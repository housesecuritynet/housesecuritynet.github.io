<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
