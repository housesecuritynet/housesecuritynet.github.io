<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely information. It has limited usefulness if a camera can not record and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and at night.</p>
