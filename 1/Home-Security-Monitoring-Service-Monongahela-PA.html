<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and minimize the number of unneeded authorities and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and should be teaching their customers how to appropriately care and set for their alarm. National and local stats have actually shown that raising fines paid straight by services and house owners have actually had no substantial effect on lowering the number of incorrect alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have taken pleasure in the advantage of authorities response to their customers' alarms without any responsibility for the precision or dependability of those alarms.</p>
