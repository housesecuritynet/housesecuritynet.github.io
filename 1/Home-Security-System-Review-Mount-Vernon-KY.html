<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof because it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
