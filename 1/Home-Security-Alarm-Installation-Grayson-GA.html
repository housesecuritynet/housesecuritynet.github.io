<h3>Security Camera System Grayson GA 30017</h3>
<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
