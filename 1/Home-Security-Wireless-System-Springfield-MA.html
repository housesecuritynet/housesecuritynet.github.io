So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, method too pricey, and not terrific.</p>
