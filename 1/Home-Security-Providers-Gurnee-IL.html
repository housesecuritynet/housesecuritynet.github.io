<p>We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, however the black and white variation can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a big offer considering the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
