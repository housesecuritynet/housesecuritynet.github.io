<h3>Best Security Home System in Granby CT</h3>
<p>The Residence Smart Security Kit, our previous runner-up, is still a solid option for some individuals. Residence has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better range for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we evaluated that also deals with HomeKit. We have actually come across a couple of technical problems while long-term screening the Abode Iota, and so will continue to test and update appropriately. We no longer suggest it.</p>

<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Terrific clearness. I wanted to set up viewing on my cellular phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter signals, for instance. However, those features come at a relatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary fee. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 per month for person detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage up to 31 days.</p>
