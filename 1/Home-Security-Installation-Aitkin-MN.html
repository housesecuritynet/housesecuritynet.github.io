CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>The Wyze Web cam can also record video to the cloud, but the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record again, which suggests you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently launched Complete Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security because if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
