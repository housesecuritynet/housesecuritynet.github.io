<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
