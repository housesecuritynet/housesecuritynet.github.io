This is likewise called the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
