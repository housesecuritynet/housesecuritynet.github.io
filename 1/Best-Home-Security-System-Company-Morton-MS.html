<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. Ring video security cameras are high definition, however they are set to record only when motion is spotted. This puts less demand on your home Wi-Fi service compared to popular rivals like Nest Secure that record continuously. Protection 1 offers total video security camera image storage services on our secure server. This enables you to have a record of events and can help aid police in the event of a burglary or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most common, and when an electrical current is continuously running around the boundary of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electric current. This trips the alarm and triggers the matching alarm. Closed-circuit systems are also tripped if the burglar cuts the power, as the circuit is broken.</p>
