Practically all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; therefore, if your internet goes down or your power heads out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their main interaction source.

It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
