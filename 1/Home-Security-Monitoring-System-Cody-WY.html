<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a number of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurer offer discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments provide several "totally free" false alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of enabling three or 4 totally free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
