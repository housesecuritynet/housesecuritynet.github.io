<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, because obviously they automobile renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too pricey, and not fantastic.</p>
<p>ADT is a household name, so we often experiment with their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task.

That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with cool clever home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
