<h2>Home Security Alarm Monitoring Oakland</h2>

<h3>Security Alarm For Home Oakland ME 04963</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
