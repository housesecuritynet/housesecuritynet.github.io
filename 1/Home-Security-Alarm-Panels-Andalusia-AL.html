The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
