<h2>IP Video Surveillance Products & Solutions Cicero</h2>
<p>In a current New York Times short article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law professor at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not breach any personal privacy issues because they are set up in public places.

This indicates they typically over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering individuals and objects to appear blown out" and with no information. So much for trying to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear correctly exposed and completely detail. It has limited usefulness if a camera can not catch and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and at night.</p>
