<p>Home security must never ever be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside your home or outdoors. While we constantly motivate central station service, some security system owners do not require or desire a main station included. Alarm Grid's self monitoring strategies are cheaper and allow access to the fantastic functions provided by Overall Connect,, or Telguard without being linked to the central station. Furthermore, aside from Self Bronze, all of Alarm Grid's self monitoring plans permit remote access to the robust home automation options made available through a Z-Wave enabled security system. Whether you live in an area where main station service is not offered or desired, self monitoring (provided world wide via internet communications) is a cost reliable option for keeping you linked and up to date with your professional security system.</p>
