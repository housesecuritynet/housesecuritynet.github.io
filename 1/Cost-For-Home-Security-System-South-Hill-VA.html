<p>Unmonitored alarm systems do not connect to expert monitoring. Rather, they sound an alarm to let you understand there is a problem and then allows you to act. This will frighten some burglars, but typically does not do much beyond that. These usually aren't part of a monitoring system either - they act by themselves.
