Lookout is truly simply a fantastic name for a kit that consists of a Wink wise home center and a couple of security oriented sensing units. You can't deactivate the system and arm. Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or set off the siren.

Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, wise lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
