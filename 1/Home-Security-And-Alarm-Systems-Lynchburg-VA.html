<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
