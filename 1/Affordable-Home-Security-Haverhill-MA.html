<p>While every property owner frets about break-ins, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently resulting in incorrect alarms. Almost all wireless home security systems utilize a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize an internet connection as their main communication source. Many web connected security systems come with a battery backup, which means if the power heads out your alarm will still work for a limited amount of time. However, if your internet goes down, sadly, you will be without an alarm system until it returns up.</p>
