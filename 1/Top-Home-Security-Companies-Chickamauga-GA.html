<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will love. It's a neat trick, and one that works pretty well, but just when you've configured the rest of the settings. I've got a big pet dog, so needed to define the locations for the camera to identify i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet will be walking. After a couple of incorrect informs, and an extremely startled other half, I started to rely on the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by mishap!
