This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more electrical wiring.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
