<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less most likely to devote criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a higher threat of being collared. This is also called the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the crime, reducing rewards from crime commission, and lowering justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the wrongdoer should be aware of the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred result.</p>
