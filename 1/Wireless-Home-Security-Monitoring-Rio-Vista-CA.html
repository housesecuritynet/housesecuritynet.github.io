<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide simple DIY installation, other companies offer (and in some cases need) professional installation. Professional installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
