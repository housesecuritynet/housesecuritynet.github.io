Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's expense from Comcast. In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used rather to any other charges due on your bill for Comcast services. You will not get a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they vehicle restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too pricey, and not excellent.</p>
