Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and sometimes, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more accurate and less regular signals.</p>
