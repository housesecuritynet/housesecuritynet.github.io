Box cameras provide an apparent indication for anyone who passes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and criminal offense. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
