Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't afford the additional equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>

Not just does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're chosen the wireless, battery powered model, however there is a wired version also if you do not wish to worry about ever needing to recharge the batteries.</p>
