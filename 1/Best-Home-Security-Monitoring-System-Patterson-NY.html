<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious aggressor, because the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the harmful assaulter to tape-record these codes and use different cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
