<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All things discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of discovering small distinctions in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature distinctions. Since objects are hardly ever precisely the exact same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>

<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
