<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Indiana</h3>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll desire Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 extra a month. If you can't pay for the additional equipment, we still like Vivint's basic bundle. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
