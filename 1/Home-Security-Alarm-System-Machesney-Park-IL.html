When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers.
