<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automated door lock and wise thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 additional a month. We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't pay for the extra equipment. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
<p>Recording the video from your security cameras requires hard drives or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are linked to has a hard drive within it. If your dealing with taped video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can use hard drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of disk drive malfunction.</p>

Some security companies utilize third-party equipment, however Vivint designs and produces a few of its own equipment If you have an issue with the equipment, you can go directly to Vivint customer service, not to a third-party producer. This makes for a more unified consumer experience.</p>
