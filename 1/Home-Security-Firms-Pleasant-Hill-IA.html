<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set amount of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-lasting plan, are ending up being more common. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
