<h3>Home Alarm Companies Kinston NC 28504</h3>
<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
